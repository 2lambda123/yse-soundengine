This is libYSE 2.0

libYSE is a cross platform sound engine, written in C++. The 1.0 version was built with JUCE, but because of possible licensing isssues and the current JUCE being unable to create usable Android libraries, JUCE support is removed in libYSE 2.0. Currently Windows and Android are supported. 

### Linux Support ###
The previous version of this project also included linux support. I do not have an interest in linux right now, but is should not be hard to add linux support again. PortAudio and libsndfile are the only dependencies for YSE now, and they are both supported on linux. If anyone wants to create the neccesary build files, I'd be happy to accept a pull request.

### iOS/Mac Support ###
This was also supported in YSE 1.0, but had to go when I decided to remove the dependency on JUCE. Adding support would mean adding other backends for reading files _(which is done by libsndfile now)_ and streaming audio output _(openSLES on Android and portaudio on Windows)_. The library is currently written with supporting multiple backends in mind, so it can't be that hard. Currently I don't have time to do this though.

### Libraries ###
Native C++ libraries are working, as well as libraries for C# _(.NET framework and .NET standard)_. The project also includes wrappers for use with xamarin forms.

### Demo ###
Demo projects are also included for Windows _(Native/C++ and WPF/C#)_, Android _(Native/C++, Android.NET/C# and Xamarin.Forms)_.

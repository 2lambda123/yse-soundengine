This is libYSE 0.7

libYSE is a cross platform sound engine for windows, macOS and linux. Android and iOS support will follow later.

The library can be installed on linux by using the known mantra:

./configure
make
sudo make install
ldconfig 

ldconfig is needed to add YSE to the library path. Linux testing has been done on ubuntu 13.04 only.

More information about YSE can be found on http://attr-x.net/yse
The git repository also includes a few tutorial programs.

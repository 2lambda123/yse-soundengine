This is libYSE 2.0

libYSE is a cross platform sound engine, written in C++. Currently Windows and Android are supported.

Native C++ libraries are working, as well as libraries for C# (.NET framework and .NET standard). The project also includes wrappers for use with xamarin forms.

Demo projects are also included for Windows (Native/C++ and WPF/C#), Android (Native/C++, Android.NET/C# and Xamarin.Forms).
